      4) feed training batches to trainer,
      5) get new checkpoint paths from trainer,
      6) feed checkpoint paths to player_manager.

    Args:
      player_trmanager_queue: Queue: to get games from the players.
      trmanager_plmanager_queue: Queue: to send checkpoint paths to the
        player manager.

      trmanager_trainer_queue: Queue: to sample mini-batches to the trainer.

        stored in the client (player) machine.
      max_samples_per_result_to_train: int: only the latest
        max_samples_per_result_to_train samples per result are kept in memory
        and used for training. This can be used to focus the training only
        on the newest samples or the restrict memory usage.
      num_games_per_checkpoint: int: number of games that are generated per
        checkpoint file. While this number is not reached, newer checkpints are
        not forwarded to the players. When this value is reached, the samples
        are also saved to disk and the training set is updated.
      batch_size: int: mini-batch size to be used in the training.
      augment_training_samples: boolean: if True, the samples are randomly
        augmented (e.g., by flipping).
      use_relative_value_labels: boolean: if False, value labels are ternary
        values in {-1, 0, 1} representing loss, draw and win. If True, win and
        loss values are relative to the number of moves remaining until
        reaching the deciding move. A win value can be any in the interval
        [0.5, 1.0]. A win value of 0.5 means that the player will win only
        after playing the maximum number of moves of the game. Conversely,
        a win value of 1.0 means that the player will win at the next move. The
        same idea is applied for losses with the sign reversed. If the network
        is able to learn such values, MCTS can prioritize faster wins and
        longer losses.
      game_config_string: string: a name for the current game.
      game_manager_module: list: a list with two string containing the name
        of the game manager module (file) and the name of the class inside of
